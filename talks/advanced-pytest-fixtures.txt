Fixtures - Dependency Injection / Isolated / Composable

Caching:
@pytest.fixture(scope='session') # function / class / ...
- Run expensive fixtures at a wider scope than default

Fixtures can use fixtures - request built-in fixture often used - pass as function arg

Skip / Fail in fixture - call pytest.skip(...) / pytest.fail(...)

@pytest.mark.marker_name - py.test -m "not marker_name"
pytest.ini - addopts = --strict - markers = marker_name ...
Can detect markers from within a fixture - request.node.get_marker

Parameterise fixtures:
@pytest.fixture(params=[...])
Access with reqest.param
Can mark params to be skipped
