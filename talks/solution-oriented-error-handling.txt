Errors - User: broken input / Ops: insufficient environment / Dev: bugs
Ideally dev writes program to provide info needed to fix errors
contextlib.closing
assert - for Dev - detect errors before release - validate pre-conditions - executable documentation
raise - errors in data or environment - for User / Ops
Error messages - "<actual> must be <expected>" - Use names and terms known to the User
Make distinction between "OSError" and "DataError" and other errors - User fixes OSError / DataError, Dev fixes other errors - DataError not in STD Lib, just custom Exception class
