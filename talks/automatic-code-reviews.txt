Manual Code Review:
- Catch errors by devs new to company / language / dev
- Learn from each other
- Catch business logic errors

Automatic Code Review:
- Style compliance
- Track quality

Out-of-date requirements - pip list -o - requires.io

Understand output - not always errors, sometimes "are you sure?"
Spend time to tune the tools - .pylintrc
Measure and track over time - relative > absolute - CI server plugins (Jenkins) - Graphite / InfluxDB - Tessera / Grafana
pylint plugins - pylint_django (github.com/landscapeio/pylint_django)

Prospector - command line version of landscape - "static analysis for humans" - not a replacement, just an easy start
