Referenced Talk: Blackbox Machine Learning - data -> black box -> predictions

Probabilistic Programming - data -> open box -> predictions - black box inference engine

Motivating example: A/B testing

Start with constructed data for clear expectations before running on real data

Which is better?
- simplest: take the mean - maximum likelihood estimate - not a bad idea - doesn't indicate uncertainty
- frequentist statistics - easy to misuse - depends on intentions when collecting data
- bayesian statistics - Bayes Formula - prior beliefs + data -> posterior beliefs - represent beliefs as random data
  In most interesting cases we can't solve Bayes Formula - Approximate it - Markov Chain Monte Carlo: draw samples from the posterior - can be applied very widely

PyMC3 - python module for probabilistic programming - still alpha: mostly docs issues

Hierarchical models - model similar algorithms - see how a group acts - partially pooled
